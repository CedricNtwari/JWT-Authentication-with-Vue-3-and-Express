# JWT Authentication System with Vue 3 and Express

A full-stack project using Vue 3, TypeScript, Pinia, and Express.js to demonstrate user authentication with JSON Web Tokens (JWT). This application serves as a learning resource and a foundation for secure authentication workflows in modern web applications.

## Project Structure

This project is divided into two main parts:

- **Client:** The frontend, built with Vue 3, TypeScript, and Pinia, powered by Vite for development speed.
- **Server:** The backend, built with Express.js and Node.js, providing secure API endpoints for authentication.

## Features

- **User Registration & Login:** Secure signup and login flows.
- **Token-Based Authentication:** Protected routes using JWT.
- **User Data Management:** Fetch and manage user details in authenticated sessions.
- **Logout Functionality:** Invalidate tokens securely.
- **Seamless Integration:** Frontend and backend communicate securely.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js:** Install the latest stable version from Node.js.
- **npm or Yarn:** A package manager for Node.js dependencies.
